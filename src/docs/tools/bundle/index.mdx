# Boundle

## Boundle Analyzer

### Source Map Explorer

Source Map Explorer allows you to have a graphic view (treemap) of the final boundle of the application.
In this way it is possible to observe which packages and / or libraries occupy most of our boundle

#### If a library is essential, how can I decrease my boundle size?
If the library allows it, it is advisable to import only the functions that are used

```js title=index.js
import dateFns from 'my-date-fns' // 200KB
dateFns.subDays(...)
```

```js title=index.js
import subDays from 'date-fns/subDays' // 2KB
subDays(...)
```
