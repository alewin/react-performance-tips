# DevTools

- **Debugger**

The `debugger` statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.

```javascript
function potentiallyBuggyCode() {
    debugger;
    // do potentially buggy stuff to examine, step through, etc.
}
```
